# Bookstore Inventory BTree Solution 

In my inventory system, I used a B-Tree to manage the data, which offers several advantages for handling large collections of books efficiently. The B-Tree ensures that the data is always sorted and allows me to perform searches, insertions, and deletions with a time complexity of O(log n). This means that even as the number of books in the inventory grows, I can still access and update records quickly.

Each book is uniquely identified by its ISBN, which I use as the key for the B-Tree. By indexing the ISBNs, I can quickly find any book I need to update or remove. When performing an update, the system first locates the book using its ISBN, and then I can easily modify the relevant details, like the title, author, or price.

Additionally, I implemented a secondary structure, a hash map, to complement the B-Tree. The hash map stores books by their names, which allows for faster lookups when I need to search by title instead of ISBN. This combination of a B-Tree and a hash map helps ensure that the system remains efficient, regardless of whether I'm searching by ISBN or name.

#  Recommendation

To optimize searches and updates in the inventory system, several strategies can be applied. First, ensuring the B-Tree is balanced and periodically checked for height can maintain efficient search times as the dataset grows. Additionally, creating secondary indices for commonly searched fields like author or category can speed up lookups. Implementing a caching system for frequently accessed books can reduce repeated searches through the B-Tree.
